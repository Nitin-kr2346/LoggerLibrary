# Logger Library Configuration Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions on configuring the Logger Library to suit different logging scenarios. Tailor your logging setup to your application's requirements by following these configuration steps.

## Basic Configuration

### Setting Log Levels

The logger library supports various log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL). You can specify the log level to control the verbosity of the log output.

Example of setting a global log level (assuming this feature is supported by your library):

```csharp
logger.SetLogLevel(LogLevel.INFO);
```
This configuration will ensure that only messages of INFO level and above (WARN, ERROR, FATAL) are logged.

## Configuring Sinks
Sinks determine where your log messages are sent. You can configure one or multiple sinks for your logger.

## Console Sink Configuration
For development or debugging purposes, you might want to see log messages in the console.

```csharp
var consoleSink = new ConsoleSink();
logger.AddSink(consoleSink);
```
## File Sink Configuration
To persist logs for later analysis, configure a file sink.

```csharp
var fileSink = new FileSink("path/to/logfile.log");
logger.AddSink(fileSink);
```
## Advanced Configuration
### Filtering by Namespace
You can configure the logger or specific sinks to filter messages based on their namespace. This is useful for focusing on logs from a particular part of your application.

## Assuming your logger library supports namespace filtering:

```csharp
logger.AddNamespaceFilter("MyApplication.Data", LogLevel.ERROR);
```
This configuration would only log ERROR level messages from the MyApplication.Data namespace.
## Custom Sink Configuration
For custom logging needs, you can implement and configure custom sinks.

```csharp
public class DatabaseSink : ISink
{
    // Implementation details
}
var databaseSink = new DatabaseSink(/* configuration parameters */);
logger.AddSink(databaseSink);
```
## Formatting Log Messages
Customize how log messages are formatted before they're sent to the sinks. If your library supports custom formatters, you can define a log message format.

Example of setting a custom message format:

```csharp
logger.SetMessageFormat("{Timestamp} [{Level}] {Namespace}: {Message}");
```
This format includes a timestamp, the log level, namespace, and the message content.
## Environment-Specific Configuration
Different environments (development, testing, production) may require different logging configurations. Here's how you can tailor logging for each environment.

## Development Environment
In development, you might want detailed logs for debugging.

```csharp
logger.SetLogLevel(LogLevel.DEBUG);
logger.AddSink(new ConsoleSink());
```
## Production Environment
In production, you might prefer logging only errors and above, and to more permanent storage.

```csharp
logger.SetLogLevel(LogLevel.ERROR);
logger.AddSink(new FileSink("path/to/production.log"));
```
## Configuration Tips
Review and test your logging configuration in different environments to ensure it meets your application's needs.
Avoid overly verbose logging in production environments to prevent performance issues.
Regularly rotate log files (for file sinks) to manage disk space usage.

## Conclusion
Properly configuring your logger library is crucial for maximizing its effectiveness and ensuring that you capture the right information. By following the guidelines outlined in this document, you can tailor the logger library to fit the specific needs of your application across different environments.
